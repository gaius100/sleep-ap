    <string name="infoquestion1">What is OSA?</string>
    <string name="infoanswer1">Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) occurs when a person repeatedly stops breathing during the night. The lack of oxygen arouses the person from sleep just enough for normal breathing to resume, but this often goes unnoticed by the person themselves (causing tiredness during the day).</string>
    <string name="infoquestion2">What are the symptoms of OSA?</string>
    <string name="infoanswer2">Usually the person will snore, or they will have noisy/laboured breathing interrupted by gasping/snorting each time their breathing resumes. Common symptoms include:\n\n\t&#8226;\tsleepiness during the day\n\t&#8226;\tsore/dry throat on awakening\n\t&#8226;\tpoor memory/concentration\n\t&#8226;\theadaches\n\t&#8226;\tirritability or short temper\n\t&#8226;\tanxiety\n\t&#8226;\tdepression\n\t&#8226;\treduced libido</string>
    <string name="infoquestion3">What causes OSA?</string>
    <string name="infoanswer3">OSA is caused by the collapse of the muscles and soft tissue in the back of the throat. This narrows or completely blocks the airway resulting in an interrupted supply of oxygen. The brain recognises this and wakes the person up enough for normal breathing to resume. There are a number of risk factors, including:\n\n\t&#8226;\tbeing overweight\n\t&#8226;\tbeing male\n\t&#8226;\tbeing over 50\n\t&#8226;\thaving a large neck\n\t&#8226;\talcohol/sedatives\n\t&#8226;\tsmoking\n\t&#8226;\tfamily history of OSA\n\t&#8226;\tdiabetes\n\t&#8226;\tnasal congestion</string>
    <string name="infoquestion4">How is OSA diagnosed?</string>
    <string name="infoanswer4">OSA is diagnosed with a full night\'s sleep study. You will either spend a night in hospital or you will be given a kit to take home. Both setups record a variety of physiological signals, and possible a questionnaire. The data will be analysed by a sleep specialist who diagnoses sleep disorders.</string>
    <string name="infoquestion5">How is OSA treated?</string>
    <string name="infoanswer5">Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, quitting smoking, and avoiding alcohol, can all help in milder cases of OSA. The most common and effective treatment is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This involves wearing a mask while asleep in order to keep the airway open. Other treatment options include surgery and dental devices.</string>
    <string name="infoquestion6">How can I minimise the risk of OSA?</string>
    <string name="infoanswer6">Some lifestyle changes can help to minimise the risk of OSA, such as:\n\n\t&#8226;\tlosing weight\n\t&#8226;\tavoiding alcohol in the evening\n\t&#8226;\tquitting smoking\n\t&#8226;\tavoiding all sedatives\n\t&#8226;\tavoiding sleeping on your back</string>

    <string name="sb1">Do you snore loudly?</string>
    <string name="sb2">Do you often feel tired during the day?</string>
    <string name="sb3">Has anyone seen you stop breathing during sleep?</string>

    <string name="odiHelpMessage">Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) is a measure of how often the amount of oxygen in your blood dips below normal. This happens frequently to OSA patients. An ODI of 5 or above means that you are at high risk of OSA.</string>
    <string name="stopBangHelpMessage">The questionnaire is used to screen for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). It can be used as a first layer of screening for OSA, but by itself it is not sufficient for any diagnostic purposes. A score of 3 or above means you are at high risk of OSA.</string>
    <string name="svmHelpMessage">Your risk of having OSA is calculated by a classifier designed to determine whether your sleep data means that you are likely to have OSA or not.</string>
