An Android application to screen for and monitor Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). The app consists of an education module including examples of OSA sound clips, a clinically-validated questionnaire to assess risk of OSA, and recording and analysis modules using accelerometry, audio and PPG data acquired from a Bluetooth pulse oximeter to classify patients as either requiring OSA treatment or not.

This application is based on ongoing research within the Intelligent Patient Monitoring group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. To report bugs or give us feedback, please send an email to sleepapdev@gmail.com.
